{The names of all players in this file have been made identical to the
spelling of ChessBase at the advice of Geurt Gijssen. More information about
the players can be looked up this way.  A match of 85 games in six matches was
one of the longest fights in chess history. Games started in the afternoon,
except for sundays. There was no time limitation and the adjournment was after
six hours. Sometimes the Irishman McDonnell thought for 11/2 hour about one
move, because he did not have to worry about a time control. It made a
profound impression on the public. His opponent the Frenchman De la
Bourdonnais was a fine attacking player. The moves were recorded by the old
Greenwood Walker. The audience behaved pleasantly, but once a newcomer started
a <->polite' conversation with the players before he sat down.   The first
match was set on twenty-one games. Draws did not count and had to be replayed
with the same colours. La Bourdonnais won by +16, =4, -5. The scores of the
following matches were (+4, -5), (+6, =1, -5), (+8, =7, -3), (+7, =1, -4) and
(+4, -5). The last match stayed unfinished because the players had other
obligations.   Popular openings were Scotch, Evans Gambit, Bishop's Game,
French Defence, Sicilian Defence, Queen's Gambit Accepted and King's Gambit.
Both players were great attackers, but the defence and technics were weak.} 1.
